# Welcome to Riverbed

Tools for content datamining and NLP at scale.

## Motivation
Given a set of content including video, image and/or text content in human language, or code, we would like to:
- create interesting features for the content, including augmenting the content.
- cluster, explore, search and visualize the content.
- label and create classifiers for the content. 
- search, filter, store and share the content to user and to other AI models 

The content may be domain specific and may change over time. If a change is significant, we would like to be notified of the changes and/or automatically 
re-run some or all of the above.
